This project implements a modern DeFi trading interface for executing the Buy Borrow Die (BBD) strategy using xBTC tokens on the Aptos blockchain.

The interface integrates seamlessly with the Petra wallet and provides a professional dashboard for staking, borrowing, repaying, and tracking portfolio performance.

The strategy assumes a 46% annual appreciation of xBTC, allowing users to borrow 30% Loan-to-Value (LTV) at a low 2% annual interest rate, with refinancing opportunities each year.

üß© Core Concept

Stake xBTC to lock assets on Aptos.

Borrow against appreciating xBTC collateral (up to 30% LTV).

Accrue Interest at 2% APR on borrowed assets.

Refinance Annually based on asset growth (assumed +46% per year).

Repeat to maximize capital efficiency while maintaining exposure to xBTC.
